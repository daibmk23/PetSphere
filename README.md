# PetSphere
We weren't able to push/pull our codes individually due to some error (we were all using different IDE, which may be the reason), so I am uploading all our files and stating each member's role in the making of our application. FXML files mentioned below are the pages of our application.

# HOW TO EXECUTE
  In the src, under application folder, there is main file named Main.java. Runing that file will display the first page of the application (Login Page in this case), but for easy navigatioin, it can be changed to any page by simply entering the name of FXML into the root/FXML loader line. Some of the saved emails and passwords are written in a text file Data.txt to test the login page. You can also register as a new user/customer and the application will take you to the user interface. To access the staff interface, you need enter a valid email id ending with "@ug.bilkent.edu.tr". One example of staff has already been save in Data.txt and staff pages can be accessed through that staff user credentials.
