We could not push/pull our codes individually due to some error (we were all using different IDEs, which may be the reason), so I am uploading all our files and stating each member's role in making our application. FXML files mentioned below are the pages of our application.

# HOW TO EXECUTE
  In the src, under the application folder, there is a main file named Main.java. Running that file will display the first page of the application (Login Page in this case), but for easy navigation, it can be changed to any page by simply entering the name of FXML into the root/FXML loader line. Some saved emails and passwords are written in a text file Data.txt to test the login page. You can also register as a new user/customer; the application will take you to the user interface. To access the staff interface, enter a valid email id ending with "@ug.bilkent.edu.tr". One example of staff has already been saved in Data.txt, and staff pages can be accessed through staff user credentials.
